This all doesn’t look any better. In fact, I feel sad.

First of all, I called my insurance company, and they confirmed that they could
only help with private diagnosis. I’m now looking for any psychologist that is
accepting new people in a reasonable timeframe.

Doctor Care Anywhere, a GP app, refused to help me with an emergency
prescription. Though a friend of mine told me that I could ask DCA for an open
referral to an endocrinologist, and I could then try to ask AXA to find me a
doctor. Tho I’m not sure this would help or would be covered.

I’ve booked an appointment with the NHS GP and with a private endocrinologist
(they’ve just canceled it and going to refer me to the [London Transgender
Clinic][]).

Meanwhile, I’m trying to get any documentation from 56 Dean Street to support
my case. I’ve also booked an appointment to talk with another private clinic,
[Gender GP][].
