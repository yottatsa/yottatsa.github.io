# This is gonna be hard
<time datetime="2020-03-28"/>

I haven’t had much progress on Thursday and Friday. Yet, at the end of the day,
I rather do less than be dead-tired.

I’ve just reached out for an assessment appointment with a mental health provider. Hopefully, they could help me to cope with anxiety thru this journey. More importantly, help me with everything I might experience after I run out of my hormones.

I feel better seeing the safety net and the pathway, even if the sight is not clear. Besides, I started taking progesterone, which might contribute to emotional stability.

HR has set an appointment with the Occupational Health clinic, this should give me more medical and at-work support options. The conversation with the Gender GP is now slowly going on.

Finally, I’ve received a few more responses from psychology doctors, though I have no appointments yet. I learned that the diagnosis might be covered by insurance as well.

*This is gonna be hard. But I’m gonna be fine eventually.*

And one more thing.

I started writing this to provide my friends, peers, and colleagues with status updates and insights. I then quickly realized that it’s more of a public diary, so I decided to publish it online. Afterward, browsing through reactions, I found a good piece of journalism on it, [Why Your Trans Friend is Freaking Out][], and oh, I feel soo related and sympathizing.

The COVID situation unique, and it’s affecting everyone in different ways. Please be kind and stay safe.
