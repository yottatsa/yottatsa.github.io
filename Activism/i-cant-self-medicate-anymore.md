# I can’t self-medicate anymore
<time datetime="2020-03-24"/>

It’s happened on Monday the 23rd of March 2020. An online pharmacy that allowed
me to order my HRT without prescription went out of business due to COVID-19.

I used to combine this pharmacy with a [56 Dean Street][56T] sexual health clinic
services for trans people to get my blood tests. With this, I needed to obtain
neither diagnosis nor prescription.
I’m completely lost now. I have about 4 weeks’ worst of medication, and after
that, I don’t know what I’m going to do.

The least can I do is to share my journey daily, so no one will die on that
hill anymore.
